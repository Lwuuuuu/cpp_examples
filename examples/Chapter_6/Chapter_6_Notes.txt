Implementations 
    C++ can be either hosted or freestanding
        Hosted - Includes all the standard library facilities as described in the standard.
        Freestanding - provide fewer standrad library facilities, as long as the folowing are provided...
            Freestanding is only meant for code running with only the most minimal operating system su pport

Types - 
    Fundamentals - 
        Boolean (bool)            
        Character Types (char and wchar_t)
        Integer types (int and long long)
        Floating-Point (double and long double)
        void 
        From these types we can construct - 
            pointer (int*)
            array types (char[])
            Reference Type (double& and vector<int>&&)
        data structures and classes
        Enumeration types for representing specific sets of values 

    For Integer Literals using suffixes on your int's can avoid implementation dependicies with machines with different # of bits to represent ints 
    unsigned bad, assume always positive, gain 1 bit tho 

    Floats use suffix f or F. long double use l or L
